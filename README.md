Toxicity classification by minimizeing unintended bias
-------------------------------------------------------

In this Blog I will try to explain a Toxicity polarity problem solution implementation for text i.e. basically a text based binary classification machine learning problem for which I will try to implement some classical and deep learning models. 
For this activity I am trying to implement a problem from Kaggle competition: “Jigshaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification”.
In this problem along with toxicity classification we have to minimize the unintended bias (which I will explain briefly in initial section).
